[knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) is a really important tool for
reproducible research. You create documents that are a mixture of
text and code; when processed through knitr, the code is replaced by
the results and/or figures produced.

[Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/), the developer of knitr, has written
clear and thorough [documentation](https://yihui.name/knitr/), many
useful
[examples](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/vignettes) and
[demos](https://yihui.name/knitr/demos), and a very nice
[book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1498716962?ie=UTF8&tag=7210-20).
Nevertheless, I thought it might be useful to have some of the basic things
explained again a bit differently.

And so, here is a brief guide to knitr, covering the fundamentals of
its use with
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/), and
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).

If you find knitr useful, consider buying
[R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1138359335?ie=UTF8&tag=7210-20)
by Yihui Xie, JJ Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund.
