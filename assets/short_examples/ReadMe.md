## Short knitr examples of figures and tables in R Markdown

This directory contains R Markdown files with the example code chunks
used in the
[page about figures and tables](https://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/pages/figs_tables.html),
plus the resulting html files.

There's also an example AsciiDoc table.

`Makefile` is a [Gnu make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make) file for
compiling the Rmd/asciidoc to html.
