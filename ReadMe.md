[Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is a really important tool for
reproducible research.

This is a brief guide to knitr, covering the fundamentals of
its use with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/), and 
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org).

View the thing [here](http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell).

If you find knitr useful, consider buying
[Yihui's book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1482203537/7210-20).
